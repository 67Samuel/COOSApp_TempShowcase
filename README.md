# COOSApp_TempShowcase
Snapshot of a pesonal project I had been working on for [COOS](https://www.coos.org.sg/) for the purpose of showing the current progress.

## Purpose of this project
- To use what I've learnt from tutorials in the making of a real application from scratch
- To familiarize myself with Android development in Kotlin
- To enable users to save and stream videos of their favourite COOS sermons on the go

## Prototype
Note: Changes to the UI have since been made

### Notes:
- This project was mostly worked on from `June 2021` to `September 2021` and then a little until about `Novemeber 2021` after which I stopped due to the need to focus more on school commitments.
- This version is not able to interact with [Vimeo](https://github.com/vimeo/vimeo-networking-java) because the credential information has not been added.
- The app is a work in progress, and was put on hold around November of 2021 because of school responsibilities and the fact that [Vimeo](https://github.com/vimeo/vimeo-networking-java)'s API was not working properly at that time because of this [issue](https://github.com/vimeo/vimeo-networking-java/issues/456).
